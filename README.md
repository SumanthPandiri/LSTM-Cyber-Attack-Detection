# Accurate and Efficient Cyber Attack Detection in Water Filtration Systems using Machine Learning

This project is focused on discovering effective data-driven methods to detect cyber attacks, specifically in cyber physical systems (CPSs). Industrial CPSs are prone to cyber attacks, especially critical infrastructure systems such as water treatment and distribution plants. The SWaT (Secure Water Treatment) dataset from the iTrust lab in Singapore is used to build a recurrent neural network (RNN) for attack detection in this study. Our research is attempting to detect attacks based on an anomaly detection approach. By predicting the normal behavior of the six-stage water treatment process and comparing with the observed sensor data, attack detection alarms are raised when the deviation is significant. Previous research in this field has focused on detecting attacks on a singular stage of the system, while our goal is to use multi-stage relationships in the system. We propose to use a stage-wise LSTM algorithm, which is expected to have greater efficiency and accuracy than previous experiments and research.
